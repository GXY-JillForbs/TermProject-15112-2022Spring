Project name: 50 Levels of Hell

Project description: 
this project is to create a vertical platformer game that requires players to control the avatar to safely drop down by jumping over to procedurally generated platforms. The environment will gradually move upwards, so players need to stay inside the screen while jumping down.

Need to include cmu_cs3_graphics.py and cmu_graphics to run the project.

To run the project:
1. Open the tp.py in VSCode and click Cmd-B to run the file
2. Choose the difficulty level
3. Using left/right or A/D keys to move left and right
4. Using the space bar to jump
